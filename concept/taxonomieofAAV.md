## Taxonomie of Learning Oject TYpes

1. Fundamental—For example, a JPEG of a hand playing a chord on a piano keyboard
1. Combined-closed—For example, a video of a hand playing an arpeggiated chord on a piano keyboard with accompanying audio.
1. Combined-open—For example, a Web page dynamically combining the previ- ously mentioned JPEG and QuickTime file together with textual material “on the fly.”
1. Generative-presentation—For example, a JAVA applet capable of graphically generating a set of staff, clef, and notes, which then positions them appropri- ately to present a chord identification problem to a student.
1. Generative-instructional—For example, an EXECUTE instructional transac- tion shell (Merrill, 1999), which both instructs and provides practice for any type of procedure, for example, the process of chord root, quality, and inver- sion identification.

## Charactéristiques

1. Number of elements combined—Describes the number of individual elements (such as video clips, images, etc.) combined in order to make the learning object.
1. Type of elements contained—Describes the type of learning objects that may be combined to form a new learning object.
1. Reusable component objects—Describes whether or not a learning object’s con- stituent objects may be individually accessed and reused in new learning contexts.
1. Common function—Describes the manner in which the learning object type is generally used.
1. Extra-object dependence—Describes whether the learning object needs informa- tion (such as location on the network) about learning objects other than itself.
1. Type of logic contained in object—Describes the common function of algorithms and procedures within the learning object.
1. Potential for inter-contextual reuse—Describes the number of different learning contexts in which the learning object might be used (that is, the object’s poten- tial for reuse in different content areas or domains).
1. Potential for intra-contextual reuse—Describes the number of times the learning object might be reused within the same content area or domain.
